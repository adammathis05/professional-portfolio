##Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The purpose of the project was to adjust the existing code to provide several improvements for a client. I replaced div markers with semantic elements so that the purpose
of each portion of the code is clear to both the browser and anyone viewing the code. I ensured the headings are in sequential order and that all image elements
have alt text for accessibility. I also added a concise title so that a tab on a browser clearly displays the client name and alludes to the content on the page.
