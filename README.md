## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The purpose of this project was to build the structure and styling for a professional portolio webpage. I have really struggled to get the syntax correct and it is reflected in the level of quality of the submission. 
- The project was very challenging for me - I was bogged down early in too many details and believe I made the entire project too complicated. Ultimately, I didn't have time to rework it - what would have probably been necessary was to start from scratch and rebuild. I thought I had a decent handle on flex but clearly need to spend additional time learning about it.
